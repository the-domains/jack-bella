I think our new parents wanted something like a Holland Lop or some other thing like a Champagne D’Argents………    
 ..ha ha ha, Champagne D’Argents?! </p>,<p>That's me with Jack. He was born with a mustache, like Erol Flyn. We were born on the same day with many others in the same hood.</p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ee7ad85891a06d3c71e3cf2d7d4cdd362c720b48.jpg">,<blockquote>Check out our birth certificates.

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Jack and Bella</h1>,<h2>Once upon a time it was just the two of us.</h2>,<p>Here we are at the Rabbit Hq ….we were 4 weeks old but they made us hang around for another 4 weeks till we were weaned off our mum.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e217328a-d23a-4ce4-9042-e2c991afbdd4.jpg">,<p>In case you didn’t know, we are Netherland Dwarfs. I think our new parents wanted something like a Holland Lop or some other thing like a Champagne D’Argents………</p>,<p>..ha ha ha, Champagne D’Argents?!</p>,<p>That's me with Jack. He was born with a mustache, like Erol Flyn. We were born on the same day with many others in the same hood.</p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ee7ad85891a06d3c71e3cf2d7d4cdd362c720b48.jpg">,<blockquote>Check out our birth certificates. We&apos;re pedigrees. I think our parents were show ponies.        
</blockquote>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d107a6cf7d6367114ab2e2e1bf8a06af49da79ca.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/edfdfeda8b55de87ecdb0170bef8221fdfb709e9.jpg">,<p>Did you know? …According to Wiki, there are 305 breeds of domestic rabbits, originating and living in 70 countries around the world.</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-location/?latitude=51.83577752045248&longitude=5.2734375&zoom=3&address=Netherlands"></iframe>,<p>Here’s the place called “The Netherlands “ . That’s not where we live..it’s where our great, great, great, great grandparents are from. We live in Singapore where temperatures can really kill a sensitive bunny.</p>,<p>Netherland Dwarfs can’t tolerate excessive changes in weather and temperatures. Anything above 90 degree fahrenheit can be dangerous . Good thing our parents have an aircon room which we can hang out in when it gets really hot.</p>]]></description>

# Jack and Bella

## Once upon a time it was just the two of us.

### Here we are at the bunny place....we were 4 weeks old but they told us we weren't 
allowed to leave till we were weaned off our mum.

## In case you didn't know, we are Netherland Dwarfs. I think our parents (they're adopted) wanted something like a Holland Lop or some other thing like a Champagne D'Argents......... ..ha ha ha, Champagne D'Argents? ...what the ?

That's me with Jack. He was born with a mustache, like Erol Flynn....Our mum (the one we adopted) said so. Jack and I were born on the same day with many others in the same hood but the rabbit head quarter said we are not from the same parents. Interesting !

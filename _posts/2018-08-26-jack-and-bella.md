# Jack and Bella

## Once upon a time it was just the two of us.

Here we are at the [Rabbit Hq][0] ....we were 4 weeks old but they made us hang around for another 4 weeks till we were [weaned][1] off our mum ! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e217328a-d23a-4ce4-9042-e2c991afbdd4.jpg)

In case you didn't know, we are Netherland Dwarfs (scientific classification: Oryctolagus cuniculus) . I think our new parents wanted something like a Holland Lop or some other thing like a Champagne D'Argents..ha ha ha, Champagne D'Argents?!

Did you know? ...According to Wiki, there are 305 breeds of domestic rabbits, originating and living in 70 countries around the world.

Here's the place called "The Netherlands " . That's not where we live..it's where our great, great, great, great grandparents are from. We live in Singapore where temperatures can really kill a sensitive bunny.

Netherland Dwarfs can't tolerate excessive changes in weather and temperatures. Anything above 90 degree fahrenheit can be dangerous . Good thing our parents have an aircon room which we can hang out in when it gets really hot.

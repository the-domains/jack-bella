# Jack and Bella

## Once upon a time it was just the two of us.

Here we are at the bunny place....we were 4 weeks old but we had to hang around for another 4 weeks till we were weaned off our mum.

In case you didn't know, we are Netherland Dwarfs. I think our new parents wanted something like a Holland Lop or some other thing like a Champagne D'Argents......... ..ha ha ha, Champagne D'Argents?! ...what the ?

That's me with Jack. He was born with a mustache, like Erol Flyn. That's what our new mum told us. Jack and I were born on the same day with many others in the same hood.

Here's the place called "The Netherlands " . That's not where we live..it's where our great, great, great, great grandparents are from.
